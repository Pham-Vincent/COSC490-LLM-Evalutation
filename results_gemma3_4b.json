This demonstrates a commitment to linguistic rights regardless of origin.\n\n*   **The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (NCIP):** This commission plays a crucial role in recognizing languages and advocating for indigenous rights, further solidifying the legal framework.\n\n**Essentially, the framework is built upon a legal mandate \u2013 the General Law \u2013 supplemented by institutional recognition (NCIP) and a broadening definition of \u2018indigenous\u2019 to include groups outside Mexico\u2019s historical boundaries.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this answer, or perhaps explore the challenges associated with implementing these frameworks?",

This variable-length encoding is extremely efficient for text that is predominantly in the English alphabet.\n   * **Code Units:**  Uses bytes (8-bit units).\n\n2. **UTF-16:**\n   * **Mechanism:**  Extends UCS-2, employing one 16-bit unit for characters that were previously representable in UCS-2, and two 16-bit units for additional characters.\n   * **Code Units:** Uses 16-bit units (2 \u00d7 8-bit bytes).\n\n3. **UCS-2:** (Now largely obsolete)\n   * **Mechanism:**  A 16-bit encoding, meaning it utilizes two 8-bit bytes to represent each Unicode character.  It was a predecessor to UTF-16.\n   * **Code Units:** Uses 16-bit units (2 \u00d7 8-bit bytes).\n\n\n**Factors Contributing to Widespread Adoption:**\n\n* **UTF-8\u2019s Dominance:**\n    * **Backward Compatibility with ASCII:** Because ASCII is the foundation of many text formats, UTF-8\u2019s compatibility with ASCII meant that existing systems and files could often be handled seamlessly.\n    * **Efficiency for English Text:**  For text predominantly in English, UTF-8 is remarkably efficient, using only one byte for common characters.\n    * **Browser and Software Support:**  Modern web browsers, operating systems, and programming languages have overwhelmingly adopted UTF-8 as the default encoding for handling Unicode text.  This creates a strong network effect.\n    * **Open Standard:** UTF-8 is an open standard, not proprietary, fostering broader adoption.\n\n* **UTF-16\u2019s Legacy & Use Cases:**\n    * **Java & .NET:** Initially, UTF-16 was the default encoding in Java and .NET, which significantly contributed to its use. While UTF-8 has overtaken it in many areas, it's still prevalent in those environments.\n    * **Character Range Coverage:**  It can represent a wider range of Unicode characters than UTF-8, though UTF-8 is generally more efficient for most use cases.\n\n* **UCS-2\u2019s Decline:**\n    * **Limited Character Set:** Its ability to represent only a portion of the Unicode standard meant it quickly became obsolete as the standard evolved.\n\n\n\n**In essence, UTF-8\u2019s combination of efficiency, backward compatibility, and overwhelming support within the web and software ecosystem has propelled it to become the dominant Unicode encoding method.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this response, such as:\n\n*   The differences in character ranges that each encoding can handle?\n*   The implications of encoding choice for specific applications (e.g., web development, database storage)?",
